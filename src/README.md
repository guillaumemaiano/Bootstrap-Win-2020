## Methodology

### Folder structure

## Testing

Note: Jasmine looks nice, but I'll go Mocha this go, since it seems to be so common.

### Mocha
Unit testing

### Chai
Expectations && fluency

### SinonJS
Spies, stubs and fakes.


### Nice pages with code examples 
(also stuff about jasmine!: https://raygun.com/blog/mocha-vs-jasmine-chai-sinon-cucumber/)
